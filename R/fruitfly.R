#' Fruit fly data 
#'
#'This data set consist of the eggs laid from 667 female fruit flies. This is a subset of the original dataset collected in Dr. Carey's laboratory at University of California, Davis. 
#'A description of the experiment can be found in Carey et al.(1998). We processed the original data set  avaiable at https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/data/medfly1000.html to include the ones that lived past 30 days. 
#'The objective is to explore the relationship of egg laying pattern and longevity of fruit flies.
